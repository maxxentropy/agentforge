  Trade-off from god-class refactoring: reduced CheckRunner from 20 to 15 methods by
  inlining helpers. The _run_command_check function inherently requires handling subprocess
  execution, exit codes, indicator overrides, error parsing, and exception handling.
  Splitting would re-introduce god-class violation. Scheduled for architectural review.
